## 👋 Hi, I’m Robin.

I'm an analyst with a product background, and I picked up data science skills during my Master of Analytics at Massey University.



## My Focus: Analyst + ML + Product Thinking

I specialize in:

- **Data wrangling and storytelling** — turning messy data into structured, usable assets.
- **Predictive modeling** — using Python to train models (regression, classification, time series, etc.) that support decision-making.
- **Business analysis** — breaking down complex systems and identifying what really drives outcomes.
- **Dashboarding** — building clear and intuitive Power BI dashboards for business users.

In short: I analyze like an **analyst**, model like a **data scientist**, and think like a **product manager**.

## 💼 Experience

With 10 years in EdTech, I’ve supported startup growth from MVP to Series C — leading end-to-end analytics to turn business needs into scalable technical solutions.

- At a coding education startup (pre-IPO), I led the revamp of the **LMS**—including the **course editor, content ops, and adaptive learning engine**. Outcome: launched a new business line, cut millions in costs, and boosted the company's Series C valuation.  
- I also led a children’s education app from 0 to 100M+ users. Joined as an early team member (10 people) and stayed through hypergrowth to 200+ employees. Led product and analytics through each funding stage — **driving product focus** for Series A, **user growth** for Series B, and **revenue growth** for Series C. Along the way, I helped scale not just the product, but how the team worked—building new workflows, adapting to change, and keeping momentum as we grew.

I’m good at working across data, systems, and business to break down complex problems. Whether designing digital products, analyzing complex datasets, or mapping workflows, I focus on turning messy problems into actionable, evidence-based solutions.

I’ve seen how the right tech can change lives—especially for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. That’s why I’m passionate about working at organizations that make learning, opportunity, or growth more accessible, so tech can serve more people.

## 🎮 Beyond Work: Systems, Stories & Serious Games

I'm obsessed with elegant systems and product architecture. I love deconstructing how products—especially media content like films, TV shows, and games—engage users through interaction, emotion, and narrative design.

I'm also an amateur **Serious Game Designer**, passionate about exploring how **gamification** can solve real-world problems, particularly in education and business. I enjoy building meaningful interactive experiences that blend play with purpose.
