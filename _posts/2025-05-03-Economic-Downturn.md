## 1. Research Focus

This report explores New Zealand's socio-economic data. Based on initial findings, it focuses on how the economic downturn has affected child well-beingâ€”particularly poverty.

## 2. Overview of Analytical Workflow

## 3. Summary of Key Findings

- The higher the unemployment, the more children fall into povertyâ€”this is true across all poverty levels.
- Children in the poorest households (40% threshold) are consistently affected when unemployment rises.
- In families closer to the poverty line (50% and 60%), the connection between job loss and child poverty goes up and down more, likely affected by external factors such as policy, economic shifts, or support programs.

## 4. Key Findings

### Long-Term Unemployment and Child Poverty

**Research Question**  
How does long-term unemployment influence child poverty across different poverty thresholds?

Lagged correlation analysis was conducted between the long-term unemployment rate and child poverty rates under three poverty thresholds (40%, 50%, 60% of median income):

**Key Insights**

- **Positive correlation**: Child poverty increases as long-term unemployment rises, across all poverty thresholds.
- **Deeper poverty is more sensitive**: The lower the poverty threshold, the stronger the correlation.
- **Interpretation**: Economic shocks affect the poorest families most severely, increasing the likelihood of children falling into deep poverty.

**Table 1. 1-Year Lag Correlation: Unemployment and Child Poverty**

| Poverty Line   | 1-Year Lag Correlation with Unemployment |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 40% Median     | 0.79 (strongest)                         |
| 50% Median     | 0.67                                     |
| 60% Median     | 0.61                                     |

### Temporal Trends in Correlation

**Research Question**  
How does the correlation between the long-term unemployment rate and the three child poverty rates vary over time?

**Key Insights**

- The **40% poverty line** shows a stable and strong correlation with long-term unemployment.  
  â†’ Suggests that children in deep poverty are consistently affected by unemployment, with fewer external disruptions.
- Correlations for the **50%** and **60%** poverty lines fluctuate more, possibly due to various external factors such as policy, economic shifts, or support programs.

**In short**: When the economy worsens, children in the deepest poverty are the most reliably and persistently affected.
