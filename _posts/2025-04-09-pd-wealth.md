**1. INTRODUCTION**

Wealth accumulation and the factors that influence it are essential topics in socio-economic research. Net worth, defined as the sum of total assets minus total debts, is influenced by various factors, including the economic environment, policy changes, individual financial
decisions, and demographic characteristics. However, an often overlooked aspect is the role of psychological factors, which can profoundly impact financial behaviour and outcomes.

This report examines the specific impact of psychological distress on net worth. For this purpose, the study is modelled using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which is analysed in the SAS EM using a simulated data set.

**2. METHODOLOGY**

In this study, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of psychological distress (PD) on wealth.

2.1 Variables

（1）Explanatory Variables: PD (psychological distress), age, male, education, income, employed, socioeconomic status  
（2）Response Variable: wealth

The variables 'socioeconomic' and 'wealth' were transformed using the ARSINH function. The transformed variables, ARSINH(socioeconomic) and ARSINH(wealth) were then used in the analysis.

2.2 Dummy Variable

Among the variables used in the model, 'male' and 'employment' are dummy variables.

In addition, to explore differences in economic behaviour across life stages, age was divided into three groups, represented by two dummy variables —— age25 and age65.

Table 1. Definitions for the dummy variables

 | Variable Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `male`        | Equal to 1 if the respondent is male, and 0 otherwise |
| `employed`    | Equal to 1 if the respondent is employed, and 0 otherwise |
| `age25`       | Equal to 1 if the respondent is younger than 25, and 0 otherwise |
| `age65`       | Equal to 1 if the respondent is over 65, and 0 otherwise |

The ages are grouped according to the economic behaviour characteristics at different stages of life. After the age of 25, most people start their careers and begin to earn a substantial income, while after the age of 65, most people are likely to receive a pension when they retire.

2.3 Data preprocessing

After the data\'s initial exploration, extreme values in the \'wealth\'
and \'socio-economic\' variables were removed. Both variables were then
transformed using the ARSINH function. This transformation reduced the
skewness of these variables and mitigated the extremity of their
distributions.

2.4 Correlation Matrix Analysis

This analysis focuses on the impact of the variable pd on wealth. To
achieve this, we have calculated Pearson\'s correlation coefficients,
focusing on variables highly correlated with pd or wealth. 

2.5 Manual Model Building and improving Models

2.5.1 Model 1 Impact of Income and PD on Wealth

The first model, starting with the effect of PD on WEALTH, gradually adds the variable INCOME to examine the effect of PD on WEALTH in depth.
In total, three models were attempted:

Model 1.1

<div align="center">

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \mu_i
$$




</div>

Model 1.2
<div align="center">

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \mu_i
$$


</div>

Model 1.3
<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + \mu_i
$$


</div>

The final equation for the Model 1 was:

<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + \mu_i
$$


</div>



2.5.2 Model 2: Impact of Income Socioeconomic and PD on Wealth

In model2, socioeconomic variables were added to further explore the
effect of the PD coefficients on wealth.

The equation for the Model 2 was:

<div align="center">



$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + \beta_4 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + \mu_i
$$

</div>

2.5.3 Model 3: Impact of pd on wealth by gender

From the correlation matrix analysis, it was found that gender and pd
were somewhat correlated. It was hypothesised that the magnitude of the
effect of pd on wealth might be different for different genders, so in
model 3, a male dummy variable and the interaction term pd\*male were
added.

The equation for the Model 3 was:

<div align="center">



$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + \beta_4 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + \beta_5 \cdot male + \beta_6 \cdot pd \cdot male + \mu_i
$$

</div>
2.5.4 Model 4: Education's Role in PD-Wealth Dynamics

In this section, the education variable was added to the model to
further optimize it. Three models were attempted in total. Finally, after adjusting the interaction term from pd\*education to pd\*(education-13), the coefficients on the pd and pd quadratic term retained statistical significance.

The equation for the Model 4 was:

<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) 
+ \beta_4 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + \beta_5 \cdot male 
+ \beta_6 \cdot pd \cdot male + \beta_7 \cdot pd \cdot education 
+ \beta_8 \cdot pd (education - 13) + \mu_i
$$


</div>

2.5.5 Model 5: Age Impact on PD-Wealth Relationship

It has been hypothesized that age is another factor influencing the
extent to which pd explains wealth. Therefore, age was grouped by
setting up a dummy variable to examine the effect of pd on wealth for
people at different life stages.

By setting dummy variables, age is divided into under 25, 25-65 and over 65. This division is because individuals typically exhibit different economic behaviors at different stages of life; the period before the age of 25 is usually a period of learning and preparing for a career, while the age of 65 is a typical retirement age, marking the transition
from full-time work to retirement.

Dummy variables are set as follows:

- age25: Equal to 1 if the respondent is below age 25, and 0 otherwise.

- age65: Equal to 1 if the respondent is above age 65, and 0 otherwise.

Also, the interacting items for dummy variables and pd were set up.

The equation for the Model 5 was:

<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot income + \beta_3 \cdot pd (pd - 12) 
+ \beta_4 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + \beta_5 \cdot male 
+ \beta_6 \cdot pd \cdot male + \beta_7 \cdot pd \cdot education 
+ \beta_8 \cdot pd (education - 13) + \beta_9 \cdot age25 
+ \beta_{10} \cdot age65 + \beta_{11} \cdot pd \cdot age25 
+ \beta_{12} \cdot pd \cdot age65 + \mu_i
$$

</div>

2.5.6 Model 6&7: Sub-sample analysis of different wealth levels

To gain insight into how individuals differ according to wealth status,
this study classifies observations into two categories according to
wealth,

(1) Negative wealth group: a subset of 9,488 observations with wealth
values less than zero.

(2) Positive wealth group: a subset of 55,778 observations with wealth values greater than zero and wealth values equal to zero.

The reason for this division is the assumption that the two
populations\' economic behavior may differ. After attempts and adjustments to the models, two separate models are finally obtained:

The equation for the Model 6(negative wealth group) was:

<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot male + \beta_3 \cdot income 
+ \beta_4 \cdot pd \cdot income + \beta_5 \cdot employed 
+ \beta_6 \cdot pd \cdot employed + \beta_7 \cdot education + \mu_i
$$


</div>

The equation for the Model 6(positive wealth group) was:

<div align="center">


$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot pd + \beta_2 \cdot male + \beta_3 \cdot income 
+ \beta_4 \cdot pd \cdot income + \beta_5 \cdot employed 
+ \beta_6 \cdot education + \beta_7 \cdot age 
+ \beta_8 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + \mu_i
$$


</div>

2.6 Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM) Assumption Tests

The CLRM hypothesis test is applied to three different models:

- Model 5: The final model for the full sample without grouping wealth
values.

- Model 6: The final model focusing on the negative wealth group,

- Model 7: The final model focuses on the positive wealth group, including
those observations with wealth values greater than or equal to zero.

2.6.1 The Average Value of Error Terms is Zero

To satisfy this assumption, the regression model must include an
intercept.

2.6.2 Test for Heteroskedasticity

White\'s test is conducted to test for Heteroskedasticity.

2.6.3 Testing for Multicollinearity Among Independent Variables

The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is used to check for
multicollinearity between variables in the model. A high VIF indicates
that the variable is highly correlated with other independent variables.

2.6.4 Testing for Autocorrelation in the Residuals

The Breusch-Godfrey test was used to examine the autocorrelation of the
residuals of the regression model.

2.6.5 Testing the Normality of Error Terms

The Jarque-Bera test was used to check the normality of residuals in
regression models.

2.6.6 Test for model misspecification

Finally, Ramsey\'s RESET test was performed to see if the model was
misspecified.

**3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

3.1 General Descriptive Statistics and data preprocessing

3.1.1 General Descriptive Statistics

The table below shows the descriptive statistics of the original dataset.

There are about 65,000 observations in total. Most of the variables have the same or close number of observations, but Education and Income have slightly fewer observations, which could mean that there are missing
values.

The mean of the Wealth variable is much higher than the median, suggesting that the data may be right-skewed and have extremely high values. This is also confirmed by the high standard deviation value, indicating significant wealth differences between individuals. The smallest value is negative, representing the presence of indebted people in the observed data. The Socioeconomic variables also exhibit a high degree of skewness and dispersion, with a median well below the mean, a significant standard deviation, and negative values in the data.

Male, White, Black, Hispanic, Other race, Employed, Divorce, Marriage, Childbirth, Family death, Laid off, and Missed work are dummy variables with values between 0 and 1.

Based on the mean value of the gender variable (Male), approximately 69.6% of the sample is male.

Among the race variables, White is the major group (about
58.5%) followed by Black (about 35.2%).

Variables representing major life events, such as Divorce, Marriage, Childbirth, Family death, Laid off, have means that represent the prevalence of the event, which can be seen from the means to indicate that these events do not occur in the majority of observations.

1.2 Histograms were plotted to confirm the data distribution for the
wealth and socioeconomic variables further.

Both plots show the highly skewed distribution of the data. Most of the
observations are clustered around the lower values, with some very high
values, resulting in a long-tailed distribution. This suggests that a
small number of people own most of the wealth. In this case, there may
be extreme values.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image2.png"  style="width:80%;">

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image3.png"  style="width:80%;">

1.3 Outlier

After analysing the scatter plots for the wealth and socioeconomic
variables, several extreme values were noted, which can be considered
outliers. Considering that wealth is usually concentrated among a small
number of people in a society, its distribution naturally exhibits a
certain degree of skewness, and therefore, our model should reflect this
social reality. However, to avoid the risk of those extreme outliers
adversely affecting the model results, we removed the two largest values
in the wealth variable and the three largest values in the socioeconomic
variable. This strategy aims to remove those outliers with the most
significant degree of deviation while retaining the characteristics of
the skewed distribution in order to study the various effects in the
context of this distribution.

The following figure shows a scatter plot comparison of these two
variables before and after removing the outlier.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image7.png"  style="width:80%;">

1.4 Data transformation

Because of the high skewness of the wealth and socioeconomic variables, these variables need to be log-transformed to better handle and interpret the data in subsequent analyses.

Due to negative values in the wealth and socioeconomic variables, the logarithmic transformation cannot be performed directly. Therefore, the arc hyperbolic sine transform will be used. This method facilitates the
computation of logarithmic values of negative and positive numbers, thus making it suitable for zero and negative values in the dataset. In addition, it maintains the interpretability of the coefficients.

The following figures (A) and (B) show the data distribution after completing the arc hyperbolic sine transform.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image8.png"  style="width:80%;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image9.png"  style="width:80%;">


The distribution of the wealth variable shows a bimodal pattern on both sides, while some of the data are concentrated around the zero value, dividing the distribution into three parts. This pattern can be
interpreted as three distinct groups in the population: a negative assets group, a positive assets group and a group with assets balanced around the zero value. The zero-value group may represent the group whose assets are at the break-even point.

Similarly, the distribution of the socioeconomic variable shows two peaks on either side of the zero point. This bimodal distribution suggests two sub-groups of socioeconomic status: a lower-status group and a higher-status group.

1.5 Correlation Matrix of Selected Variables

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image10.png"  style="width:80%;">

From the table above, pd is slightly correlated negatively
with age(r=-0.115), suggesting that younger people may be more prone to
higher levels of psychological distress. This may reflect the unique
challenges and pressures faced by the younger population.

There is also a weak negative correlation(r=-0.141) between pd and male,
which indicates a gender difference in the occurrence of psychological
distress, suggesting that males have slightly lower levels of
psychological distress than females in this sample.

The negative correlation(r=-0.134) between education and pd implies that
those with higher levels of education may have slightly lower levels of
psychological distress. This may be due to higher education improving
problem-solving skills and resilience.

A moderate negative correlation(r=-0.224) between income and pd suggests
that high levels of psychological distress may reduce earning capacity. On the other hand, it could also be the reason that financial security on mental health, with more financial resources buffering stress.

A slight negative correlation(r=-0.131) exists
between employed and pd. Employment usually leads to a stable income and a sense of purpose, and therefore may help to reduce psychological stress.

A moderate negative correlation(r=-0.196)
between pd and socioeconomic suggests that people of
lower socio-economic status tend to experience higher levels of psychological distress. This may be because lower socio-economic status
means limited access to economic resources and social support, which will result in some degree of psychological stress.

**3. Results of the Model Building**

3.1 Model 1: Impact of Income and PD on Wealth

3.1.1 In the initial model, only the effect of pd on wealth was examined.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image11.png"  style="width:80%;">

The model shows that the estimated value of the intercept is 9.02196,
which can be interpreted as the baseline level of an individual\'s wealth status in the absence of psychological stress (pd=0). The coefficient of pd is -0.35762, indicating a negative correlation, meaning that the higher the psychological distress, the lower the level of wealth, specifically, for every unit increase in pd, the level of transformed wealth (ARSINH(wealth)) decreases by an average of 0.35762 units. The explanatory power of the model is relatively low, with an R-squared value of 0.0301, indicating that the pd variable explains only 3.01 per cent of the variation in wealth.

3.1.2

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image12.png"  style="width:80%;">

After the inclusion of the income, the intercept drops to -15.08611, indicating a lower baseline wealth level after accounting for the effects of psychological distress (pd) and income (INCOME). This may indicate that in the absence of psychological distress and income, individuals\' wealth levels are at relatively low levels.

The coefficient of psychological distress (pd) also changes, reflecting the fact that the effect of pd on wealth may be overestimated without controlling for income. The addition of the income variable resulted in a coefficient of 2.21909 with a highly significant p-value (\<0.0001), which implies that for every percentage point increase in income, ARSINH(WEALTH) is expected to increase by an average of 2.21909 units.
This illustrates the important role of income in an individual\'s wealth level.

It can be inferred that an increase in psychological stress may lead to a decrease in the ability to generate income, which in turn affects an individual\'s wealth accumulation.

Finally, the R-squared value of the model has increased to 0.1100, which means that the new model explains changes in wealth levels better than the original model. Despite the improvement, the value is still relatively low, suggesting that the model does not explain most of the variation.

3.1.3 After finding that psychological distress (pd) has a negative effect on wealth, it was further hypothesised that the negative effect of pd on wealth may be exacerbated with increasing psychological distress.

The model was adjusted by adding a quadratic term for pd, which is pd\*(pd-12). The [value of 12 is a threshold based on the Kessler Psychological Stress Scale (K6),]{.mark} whereby a score of more than 12 indicates the presence of a serious psychological problem.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image13.png"  style="width:80%;">


The results of the model show that the coefficient of the quadratic term
of psychological stress is 0.01180, which is positive, indicating that
as psychological stress increases, its negative impact on the level of
wealth gradually diminishes.

This may be due to the fact that individuals\' ability to cope with high
levels of psychological stress improves over time, thereby alleviating
the negative impact on wealth.

Another speculation is that in real life, when psychological stress
exceeds the threshold of 12, individuals may seek and receive more help
from social support systems ( such as family, friends, and social
service organisations), which can help to reduce some of the negative
effects of stress on the economy.

After adjustments, The regression Model for Model 1 is:

<div align="center">
$$
\mathrm{ARSINH}(wealth) = -14.88050 - 0.24268 \cdot pd + 0.01180 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + 2.22072 \cdot income
$$
</div>

3.2 Model 2: Impact of Income Socioeconomic and PD on Wealth

Model 2 focuses on the effect of the inclusion of the socioeconomic
variable on the model.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image14.png"  style="width:80%;">

As can be seen from the table, the p-values for all parameter estimates
are less than 0.0001, indicating statistical significance.

The coefficient of PD decreases from -0.24268 to -0.22656.Although this
change is small, it suggests that socioeconomic status may influence the
relationship between psychological distress and wealth to some extent.
In other words, psychological distress in general has a negative effect
on wealth accumulation, and there may be some subtle differences in this
effect between high and low socioeconomic classes.

It can also be seen from the table that the income coefficient has
decreased from 2.22072 to 1.86178. This suggests that the effect of
income on wealth may be overestimated when socioeconomic is not
included. This suggests that socioeconomic may include other
wealth-related factors (for example, inheritance, investment income,
etc.), especially in the higher socioeconomic status groups, which may
be more important than wage income.

The coefficient for socio-economic status is 0.08272, which means that
for every unit increase in ARSINH (socioeconomic), there is an increase
of 0.08272 units in ARSINH (wealth). This positive coefficient also
suggests that an increase in socioeconomic status provides individuals
with more financial resources, better investment opportunities and more
effective financial management services, all of which contribute to
improved wealth accumulation.

The regression Model for Model 2 is:

<div align="center">
$$
\mathrm{ARSINH}(wealth) = -11.53767 - 0.22656 \cdot pd + 0.01231 \cdot pd (pd - 12) + 1.86178 \cdot income + 0.08272 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic)
$$
</div>


3.3 Model 3: Impact of pd on wealth by gender

Model 3 incorporates the MALE variable to explore gender differences in
the impact of pd on wealth.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image15.png"  style="width:80%;">

With the introduction of the new variable, the Adj R-sq for Model 3
improves from 0.1180 to 0.1236, and this slight improvement suggests
that the model\'s ability to explain ARSINH(wealth) is not significantly
enhanced.

The coefficients of both pd and pdquadratic change and the T-value
decreases, indicating that the addition of the new variable calibrates
the coefficients of pd but also increases the variability of the
coefficients, making them more volatile.

The coefficient for male is 1.63281, indicating that men are on average
1.63281 ARSINH (wealth) units wealthier than women, holding all other
variables constant.

In addition, an interaction term, pd\*male, is introduced to examine the
interaction between psychological stress and gender. The coefficient of
this interaction term is -0.04833, indicating that as psychological
stress increases, the wealth growth of males relative to females
decreases. This implies that an increase in psychological stress has a
more adverse effect on men\'s wealth than on women\'s wealth, thus
reducing men\'s economic advantage.

This may be due to the fact that men may tend to take higher financial
risks when making decisions, which normally benefits wealth
accumulation. However, in high-stress situations, such risk-taking may
lead to greater financial losses, thereby narrowing the wealth gap with
women.

This may also be explained by the fact that women may exhibit greater
mental and emotional resilience in the face of life\'s stresses. As
stress increases, this resilience may help women to better manage stress
and maintain job performance and income.

The regression Model for Model 3 is:

<div align="center">
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{ARSINH}(wealth) =\ & -10.66989 - 0.18762 \cdot pd + 0.01118 \cdot pd (pd - 12) \\
& + 1.67351 \cdot income + 0.07394 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) \\
& + 1.63281 \cdot male - 0.04833 \cdot pd \cdot male
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>


3.4. Model 4: Education\'s Role in PD-Wealth Dynamics

3.4.1 In this step, education variable is incorporated into the model.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image16.png"  style="width:80%;">

The table above shows that the coefficient on education is -0.17137,
indicating that each additional year of education reduces ARSINH
(wealth) by 0.17137 units on average. This suggests that higher levels
of education are not directly associated with higher levels of wealth in
the sample. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as it is generally
assumed that higher levels of education are associated with greater
wealth, and this result may be influenced by other factors. For example,
younger individuals may have just completed tertiary education and have
not yet accumulated wealth, whereas older individuals with lower levels
of education may have had more time to accumulate wealth.

In addition, the coefficients and T-values of pd and its quadratic term
change very little after controlling for educational attainment, which
provides a preliminary indication that the effect of pd on wealth may
not be strongly related to educational attainment. In other words,
excessive psychological stress appears to consistently reduce wealth
regardless of educational level.

3.4.2 To investigate this hypothesis further, we introduced an
interaction term between pd and education into the model.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image17.png"  style="width:80%;">

The table above shows that the p-value of the pd coefficient increases
(p=0.5792) and the coefficient is no longer significant after adding
pd\*education. When this interaction term is added to the model, the pd
coefficient now represents the effect of a one-unit change in pd on
ARSINH (wealth) when education is zero. However, since most of the
observations in the dataset do not have zero education, this may account
for the reduced statistical significance of the pd coefficient.

3.4.3 It is also worth noting that the median and mean for education are
both close to 13 years, which is roughly the time taken to complete
secondary education. This suggests that the majority of people in
society have completed at least secondary education, while only some
choose to go on to higher levels of education. It is therefore
appropriate to use 13 as a cut-off to adjust the interaction term to
pd\*(education-13). This adjustment sets the benchmark at the level of
education at the end of high school and the beginning of college
education, thus providing a more reasonable measure of how bias in years
of education affects the impact of pd on wealth.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image18.png"  style="width:80%;">

As can be seen in table above, the standard errors of pd and pdquadratic
decrease and the t-values improve.

The pdedu13 coefficient is -0.01686, indicating that for individuals
with more than 13 years of education, each additional year of education
is associated with an additional increase in the negative impact of
psychological distress, reducing ARSINH(wealth) by 0.01686 units,
holding all else constant.

Specifically, if an individual is college educated or higher, they
experience a greater decrease in wealth when dealing with psychological
stress.

The reason behind this may be that higher education often comes with
higher financial costs, such as student loans. These loans can put
long-term financial strain on an individual. Additionally, while
individuals with higher education may theoretically have more resources
and skills to manage stress. However, they may also be exposed to more
sources of stress, including work pressures, social competition, etc.

Another possible reason is that individuals with fewer years of
education may have entered the labour market earlier, and the life and
work experience they have gained may make them better able to cope with
financial stress.

Finally, after adjustment, the model\'s Adjusted R-Sq improves very
slightly from 0.1236 to 0.1268. this means that the current model can
only explain about 12.68 per cent of the variance in ARSINH(wealth).
While this change indicates an increase in the model\'s ability to
explain variation, overall the adjusted coefficient of determination
remains relatively low.

The regression Model for Model 4 is:

<div align="center">
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{ARSINH}(wealth) =\ & -10.38327 - 0.19813 \cdot pd + 0.00865 \cdot pd (pd - 12) \\
& + 1.78638 \cdot income + 0.08409 \cdot \mathrm{ARSINH}(socioeconomic) + 1.56645 \cdot male \\
& - 0.04849 \cdot pd \cdot male - 0.11411 \cdot education - 0.01686 \cdot pd \cdot (education - 13)
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>


3.5 Model 5: Age Impact on PD-Wealth Relationship

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image19.png"  style="width:80%;">


3.5.1 As can be seen in the table, holding all other variables constant,
the coefficient of age65 compared to the benchmark group (age group
25-65) is 4.32067, meaning that people over 65 are on average 4.32067
ARSINH(wealth) units wealthier than the 25-65 age group, while people
under 25 are 2.20005 ARSINH(wealth) units less wealthy than the
benchmark group.

The t-value of PD drops from -15.00 to -11.22, indicating that the
statistical significance of PD decreases with the inclusion of age, but
the t-value is still much greater than 2, indicating that the effect of
PD on wealth is still statistically significant even after controlling
for age. This suggests that psychological stress is still an important
factor influencing wealth.

Meanwhile, the coefficient of PD changed from -0.19818 to -0.14570,
indicating that, controlling for age, the negative impact of
psychological stress on wealth decreased. This may reflect the different
ability to react and cope with psychological stress at different ages.

3.5.2 By incorporating the interaction terms pd\*age65 and pd\*age25,
the effect of pd on wealth was examined for different age groups.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image20.png"  style="width:80%;">


The coefficients on the interaction terms between pd and age group (over
65 and under 25) are both positive, 0.08551 and 0.09586 respectively,
suggesting that psychological stress has a more positive impact on
wealth in these age groups than in the middle-aged group (25-65), or
that psychological stress has a less negative impact on their wealth
accumulation.

This may be because people aged 25-65 tend to be under the double
pressure of career development and family responsibilities and are often
the main financial contributors to their families. Stresses such as job
insecurity, divorce or parenting in this age group can directly reduce
their wealth accumulation.

Young people under the age of 25 may adopt positive strategies to cope
with stress, such as working overtime or taking on higher paid jobs,
effectively turning stress into an incentive to accumulate wealth.

Also, most people over the age of 65 are likely to be retired and may
have stable pensions and savings. Moreover, their rich life experience
may provide them with more effective stress coping mechanisms.

The adj R-sq for this model improves to 0.1621, explaining 16.21% of the
variance in the model.

The regression Model for Model 5 is:

3.6 Sub-sample analysis of different wealth levels

As this study focuses on the effect of PD on WEALTH, the main objective
is to control for the statistical significance of PD while improving the
unbiasedness of PD and the overall explanatory power of the model. There
was also a focus on increasing the adj R-sq value to ensure that the
explanatory power of the model was maximized. After fitting and
optimization, two models were finalized:

Model 6: Negative wealth Group

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image21.png"  style="width:80%;">


Model 7: Positive wealth Group

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image22.png"  style="width:80%;">


Comparing these two models and model 5, there are the following
additional findings:

(1) The adjusted R-square of the Model 6 does not lift easily.

As can be seen from the two graphs above, Model 7 has an Adj R-sq of
0.4143, which is significantly higher than model 6 (Adj R-Sq: 0.1288)
and model 5 (Adj R-Sq: 0.1621). Model 7 performs much better in
explaining the variance in ARSINH(wealth). Specifically, Model 7
explains about 41.43% of the variation in the response variable
ARSINH(wealth).

This difference may reflect the fact that the positive wealth group
shows a more pronounced pattern and consistency in variables and wealth.
In contrast, the negative wealth group lacks a clear pattern in these
areas. This makes it more difficult to explain their wealth changes with
a single model. There is also a possible reason for this: Model 6 does
not include other important factors that have a significant impact on
the financial situation, and these factors are not in the data set
currently analysed.

(2)The coefficients of income are reversed in model 6 and model 7

The coefficients of INCOME for model6 and model7 are -0.26295 and
0.99411 respectively, which means that for the negative wealth group,
ARSINH(wealth) decreases by an average of 0.26295 units for every 1%
increase in income, holding all other variables constant and with a pd
of zero. In contrast, for the positive wealth group, for every 1%
increase in income, ARSINH(wealth) increases by an average of 0.99411
units, holding all other variables constant and with a pd of zero.

This means that for both groups, INCOME affects WEALTH in opposite
directions. Typically, an increase in income leads to an increase in
wealth. This is intuitive, since an increase in income provides more
money for saving and investing, thus increasing an individual\'s total assets.

However, among the indebted, income is used more for consumption than
for investment. This can affect wealth accumulation. In addition, an
increase in income may also lead to an increase in consumption rather
than debt repayment or savings. This phenomenon is often referred to as
'lifestyle inflation', in which individuals increase their standard of
living and consumption habits as their income rises, possibly in the
short term, without considering long-term financial security.

In addition, the interaction term Pd\*income has a positive coefficient
in both groups. This suggests that at higher incomes, psychological
stress may act as an incentive to drive individuals to take action to
maintain or increase their wealth, thus making it possible to get out of
debt or accumulate assets more efficiently.

(3)The coefficients of male are reversed in model 6 and model 7

In Model 6, the coefficient of male is negative (-0.21856), indicating that men in the negative wealth group are on average 0.21856 ARSINH(wealth) units lower than women, controlling for other variables. In contrast, in Model 7, women in the positive wealth group are on average 0.78942 ARSINH(wealth) units lower than men.

This finding may imply that women are more cautious in accumulating
wealth compared to men, preferring steady investment and long-term
financial planning. This behaviour may have reduced the loss of their
wealth during periods of economic instability, but it may also have
limited the rate of wealth increase during periods of economic growth.
Further analysis is needed to gain a deeper understanding of gender
differences in wealth distribution and behaviour.

(4)Unlike Models 5 and 6, in Model 7, the coefficient on EDUCATION is
positive

In Model 7, for the positive wealth group, the coefficient on education
is positive (0.18584), indicating that for each additional year of
education, an individual\'s ARSINH(wealth) increases by an average of
0.18584 units, controlling for other variables held constant. This
suggests that in the positive wealth group, individuals with higher
levels of education may already be earning a return on their investment
in education.

2.8 CLRM Assumption Tests Results

2.8.1. The Average Value of Error Terms is Zero

Since the intercepts in Models 5, 6 and 7 all have p-values less than
0.0001, they are significant and must be included in the model. Keeping
these intercepts ensures that the mean of the error term in the model is
zero, which is consistent with the statistical assumptions of the CLRM.

2.8.2 test for Heteroskedasticity

Model 5

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image23.png"  style="width:80%;">


Model 6

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image24.png"  style="width:80%;">


Model 7

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image25.png"  style="width:80%;">

The p-values of White's tests for Models 5, 6, and 7 were less than
0.0001. These results led to the rejection of the null hypothesis in
White's test, which posits that the disturbances are homoscedastic.
Therefore, Models 5, 6, and 7 violate the assumption of
homoscedasticity. The error terms in these models are heteroscedastic.

3\. Testing for Multicollinearity Among Independent Variables

Model 5

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image26.png"  style="width:80%;">

As seen from the results, all of the variables have VIF values below 5,
indicating low covariance between them.

Model 6

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image27.png"  style="width:80%;">

Model 7

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image28.png"  style="width:80%;">

In Models 6 and 7, the VIF values for pd and its interaction term
pd\*income are significantly higher than the generally accepted
thresholds, suggesting a high correlation between the two. This is
consistent with our hypothesis that psychological distress (PD) may
affect wealth accumulation through a direct correlation with income.
This high degree of multicollinearity may affect the stability and
reliability of the coefficients of these variables, as it may increase
the standard errors of the coefficients and reduce the reliability of
statistical tests.

4\. Testing for Autocorrelation in the Residuals

</div>


The table shows the results of the Breusch-Godfrey test for model 5, 6,
7. The p-values corresponding to the Lagrangian multiplier (LM)
statistics from the first order (AR(1)) to the tenth order (AR(10)) are
extremely low (p\<0.0001), providing sufficient evidence to reject the
null hypothesis that the model residuals are not autocorrelated. That
is, the error terms in Model 5, 6, 7 are correlated with each other.

The occurrence of this autocorrelation may be related to the fact that
the dataset is panel data; the error of each observation at one point in
time may affect its error at subsequent points in time. For example, the
effect of individual psychological distress (PD) on wealth may carry
over over time. Given this, the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) may
not be the best way to analyse such data, as OLS assumes that the error
terms are independent of each other, an assumption that may not hold for
panel data.

5\. Testing the Normality of Error Terms

Model 5

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image32.png"  style="width:80%;">

Model 6

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image33.png"  style="width:80%;">

Model 7

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image34.png"  style="width:80%;">

In Models 5, 6 and 7, the Jarque-Bera statistic is significantly high
and the p-values are extremely low (p \< 0.0001), indicating that the
residuals in these models deviate from a normal distribution.
Consequently, the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally
distributed is rejected.

6.Test for model misspecification
<div align="center">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image35.png"  style="width:80%;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image36.png"  style="width:80%;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pdwealth/media/image37.png"  style="width:80%;">
</div>
The results of the RESET test show that all p-values are well below the
critical value of 0.0001, whether the test is performed on the second,
third or fourth power of ARSINH(wealth). This provides strong evidence
to reject the null hypothesis H0: the functional form of the model is
correct, suggesting that existing models may not accurately capture the
true relationship between explanatory and response variables. It could
also mean that some important variables are missing from the model.

One possible explanation is a dynamic relationship that is not captured
by the model. For example, the effect of an individual\'s psychological
distress (PD) on wealth (Wealth) may not be immediately apparent, but
may manifest itself over time, with a lag during which individuals may
adjust their financial behavior.

Similarly, the positive impact of education on income is usually a
cumulative process as individuals complete their education, enter the
labor market and gain experience. In addition, given that the data span
covers the period from 2003 to 2019, the model may fail to control for
the impact of macroeconomic factors such as economic cycles and policy changes. Over such a long time span, global economic events or national economic changes may have had a significant impact on the wealth of individuals, all of which may lead to model misspecification if these factors are not properly accounted for and controlled for in the model.

4\. CONCLUSION

This report examines the relationship between psychological distress and wealth accumulation, providing insights into the various factors that influence wealth through several models. The results suggest that psychological distress has a consistently negative effect on wealth, and this effect varies across populations.

The main findings of our modelling are that income and socio-economic status significantly buffer the negative effects of psychological distress. In addition, the impact of psychological distress on wealth varies by gender and age. Men and those in the 25-65 age group appear to have a greater negative impact on their wealth due to psychological distress, which may be due to their primary role in finances and the associated stress. Furthermore, the pattern of wealth accumulation is clearer for the positive wealth group than for the negative wealth group. For example, wealth is strongly influenced by variables such as education and employment, suggesting that the pathways of wealth accumulation are more predictable for those who already have wealth.

However, this study also finds some counterintuitive results, such as
the fact that an increase in education levels seems to be associated
with a decrease in wealth accumulation. This counterintuitive phenomenon
may be due to the time-lagged effect of education on wealth. Typically,
higher investments in education take years of work experience to pay
off, and higher education loans may first have to be repaid. However,
ordinary least squares (OLS) models may not be effective in capturing
this dynamic time effect.

In addition, it is worth noting that the panel data used in this study has the characteristics of both time series and cross-sectional data.
The OLS model assumes that the data are independent of each other, which may not be applicable to the characteristics of the panel data. The test results of the CLRM also indicate that the model may suffer from heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and misspecification, which further suggests that the use of the OLS approach may not be appropriate.

Therefore, to better explore the impact of psychological stress on wealth accumulation, future research should consider modelling approaches that are more suitable for dealing with panel data, such as fixed or random effects models, which can better take into account the effect of time factors on variables.
